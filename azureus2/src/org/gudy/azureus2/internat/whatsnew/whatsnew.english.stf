+1. What's new in Azureus 2.3.0.0

!1.1 Distributed Database
 Azureus now has a distributed, decentralised database that can be used to track decentralised torrents. This permits both "trackerless" torrents and the maintenance of swarms where the tracker has become unavailable or where the torrent was removed from the tracker.
 It uses the UDP protocol, if you have a firewall/router, you will need to open/forward the UDP port in the same way you did with TCP to download data.
 
*1.1.1 Magnet Links
 For torrents that are tracked decentrally, Azureus can export a "Magnet Link". This is of the form "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..." and can be used to download the torrent from the distributed database via the "open->url" menu item.
 
!1.2 Extended Protocol
 Azureus now supports an extended protocol, which is aimed at allowing plugins to use the connections created by Azureus to add functionality to the program. Other clients developers can see the specifications of this extension protocol at http://azureus.aelitis.com/wiki/XXXX . Plugin developers can check the plugin javadocs to see how to use it.
 For example, the JPC and Chat plugins make use of this extension protocol.

!1.3 JPC
 Joltid Peer Cache (JPC) is now integrated into Azureus. For users whose ISP support this, JPC should allow faster downloads, while helping the ISP reduce its bandwidth costs. The JPC Plugin is safe in the way that your ISP won't know what you are downloading, and can't use it to spy on you. The JPC plugin can be disabled through Tools > Options > Plugins > JPC.
  
!1.4 Featured Plugins
 The DHT and the Extended Protocol allowed us to develop some new plugins, which we believe are nice. We won't auto install them for you, but we recommend all users who might be interested in them to install them using the Plugins > Installation Wizard menu.
 
*1.4.1 Chat
 This plugin will create a discussion channel for each torrent you are downloading. Each channel is independent, and you are free to discuss whatever you want inside the channel. This plugin makes use of the Extended Protocol. Developers of other clients willing to implement the chat functionality in their client are welcome to take a look at the very simple protocol used and described here : http://azureus.aelitis.com/wiki/index.php/ChatPlugin .
 You can also create/join an arbitrary channel by typing in its name inside the plugin. This will have the effect of creating a "virtual" torrent, with no seeds, in order to allow users to create connections to chat. The "virtual" torrents make use of the DHT as their tracker, so while you can use the Chat Plugin without the DHT, you won't be able to use the virtual channel feature if you disable the DHT.
 
*1.4.2 Ratings & Comments
 This plugin will allow you to see ratings & comments from other users, as well as rate and comment a torrent yourself (right click the torrent in "My Torrents" then choose "ratings & comments". This plugin uses the DHT, so you need to have the DHT enabled for it to work.
 

+2. Upgrade Advice

!2.1 Java 5.0
 Azureus is written in Java and requires the Java runtime. We recommend Java 5.0 (also known as 1.5) as it has better performance and reliability - please upgrade if necessary.
 You'll find torrents to update Java here : http://azureus.sourceforge.net/download.php
 Download the one for your system, close Azureus, execute the downloaded file, then restart Azureus.
 WinXP users will have to go to Tools > Config > Interface > Display, and re-check the "Enable XP Style" option.
 
!2.2 NOD32
 NOD32 (http://www.nod32.com/) is an antivirus which is known to be incompatible with Azureus, causing 100% CPU usage.
 See http://azureus.aelitis.com/wiki/index.php/LikelyNetworkDisconnectReconnect
 

+3. Common Issues

!3.1 NAT "error"
 NAT means "Network Address Translation". The NAT test in Azureus tells you whether or not you are connectable from people on the internet. You'll get better speeds if you ARE connectable.
 Please don't contact us in order to solve NAT issues, as plenty resources are available on the internet about it. First check :
 - http://azureus.aelitis.com/wiki/index.php/PortForwarding
 - http://www.portforward.com
 

!3.2 Azureus Crashing
 If your Azureus is crashing, the most likely reason is an issue with your network components (card, drivers, OS). We highly recommend that you update all network related components. If this doesn't help, then the reason is that your system probably can't handle that many connections.
 Lower the number of connections in Azureus (Tools > Options > Transfer > Maximum number of connections per torrent / globally), try a low value like 30 first.
