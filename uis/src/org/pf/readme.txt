This is a stripped down version of Manfred Duchrows Programmer's Freind class
library. No code was changed, only classes irrelevant for Azureus were left out.
The complete library can be found on its homepage:

Hello!

It's been brought to my attention that some libraries bundled with Vuze has an incompatible license. Starting out easy, the attached patch is my attempt (please bear with me, I'm no programmer) to re-implement the functionality of the ProgrammersFriend classes which are used in Vuze. 
Comments and suggestions are very welcome (-:

These classes were added in 2004 or earlier and around that time were actually LGPL:

and the license was changed somewhere between

and

to be CPL.
